    "There are several problems for using simple waveforms as constant or even gaussian, such as the possibility of exciting the $\\ket{1}$ o $\\ket{0}$ to higher energy levels or a dephasing effect that could change the resonance frequency of the qubit during the Rabi oscillation, both due to the interaction of the pulse that depends on the anharmonicity of the system. A very popular solution to mitigate this effects is the so called Derivative Reduction by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG). Originally, we assumed a very specific shape for the driving signal:\n",
    "$$V_d(t)=V_0s(t)\\left[\\mathcal{I}\\sin(\\omega_d t) + \\mathcal{Q}\\cos(\\omega_d t)\\right],$$\n",

For $\\lambda = 0$ we recover the no-DRAG pulse, for $\\lambda=0.5$ we optimally reduce the dephasing and for $\\lambda=1$ we optimally reduce the leakage error to higher energy states. The problem is that we can't directly apply gates like this (only those of the original $s(t)$ shape), so we need to find a way to efficiently implement them by discretization.<br>\n",
