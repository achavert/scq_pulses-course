## Pulse control with OpenPulse

A practical introduction to pulse-level control of superconducting qubits with the OpenPulse and Qmio's implemented features.

## Requirements
This course assumes that you have access to the QMIO CPD nodes at CESGA (through a @qmio.cesga.es account).

## Contents

1. [OpenPulse Grammar](notebooks/01_openpulse_grammar/openpulse_grammar.html): documentation for OpenQasm3.0's OpenPulse grammar and QMIO's implemented features.
2. **Qmio Example Experiments**: a folder with a set of experiment examples with QMIO.
3. [Pulse Control Theory](notebooks/03_pulse_control_theory/pulse_control_theory.html): introduction to superconducting qubits' physics and driving.
