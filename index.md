## Pulse control with OpenPulse

A practical introduction to pulse-level control of superconducting qubits with the OpenPulse and Qmio's implemented features.

## Requirements
This course assumes that you have access to the Qmio CPD nodes at CESGA (through a @qmio.cesga.es account).

## Contents

1. **OpenPulse grammar**: documentation for OpenQasm3.0's OpenPulse grammar and Qmio's implemented features.
2. **Qmio example experiments**: a folder with a set of experiment examples with Qmio.
3. **Pulse control theory**: introduction to superconducting qubits' physics and driving.
