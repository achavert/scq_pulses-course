## Pulse-level control at Qmio with OpenPulse

A practical introduction to pulse-level control of superconducting qubits with the OpenPulse and Qmio's implemented features.



## Contents

This course is composed of three notebooks that explain the superconducting qubit system and its control at pulse level, oriented to understand how the native quantum gates from Qmio are physically implemented, and to be able to design experiments in Qmio. Also, it includes a revised documentation of the OpenPulse grammar, specifically for Qmio's available features, and a more in depth dive into the theory of pulse control.
