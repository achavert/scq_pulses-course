[2. **Single-qubit driving**](/content/notebook02.md)

[3. **Two-qubit driving**](/content/notebook03.md)

### Documentation
- OpenPulse grammar documentation for Qmio

- Tranmon and pulse-level control theory


## Requirements
To run the notebooks of this course, it's required to have access to the Qmio CPD nodes at CESGA (through a @qmio.cesga.es account).
