# Qubit Pulse Control with OpenPulse
The objective of this course is to be a practical introduction to pulse-level control of superconducting qubits with the OpenPulse grammar from OpenQasm 3.0, but also explain the physical concepts to be able to understand and design experiments with this language. Additionally, we'll focus on the particular hardware backend from QMIO, taking a look into which features are implemented.

## Requirements
This course assumes that you have access to the QMIO CPD nodes at CESGA (through a @qmio.cesga.es account).

## Contents

1. **OpenPulse Grammar**: introduction to OpenQasm 3.0's OpenPulse grammar and QMIO's implemented features.
2. **Qmio Example Experiments**: a folder with a set of experiment examples with QMIO.
3. **Pulse Control Theory**: introduction to superconducting qubits' physics and driving.


The material for this course will be in Jupyter Notebooks format (.ipynb), but they will also be available in PDF.
