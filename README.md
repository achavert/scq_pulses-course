# Superconducting Qubits Pulse Control with OpenPulse
The objective of this course is to be a practical introduction to pulse-level control of superconducting qubits with the OpenPulse grammar from OpenQasm 3.0, but also explain the physical concepts to be able to understand and design experiments with this language. Additionally, we'll focus on the particular hardware backend from QMIO, taking a look into which features are implemented.

## Requirements
This course assumes that you have access to the QMIO HPC nodes at CESGA (through a @qmio.cesga.es account).

## Content
The material for this course will be in Jupyter Notebooks format (.ipynb), but they will also be available in PDF. <br>
This are the contents of the course:
1. **Pulse Control Theory**: introduction to superconducting qubits' physics, drive and measurement.
2. **OpenPulse Grammar**: introduction to OpenQasm 3.0's OpenPulse grammar and QMIO's implemented features.
3. **Example Experiments**: a folder with a set of experiment examples with QMIO.
