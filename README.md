# Superconducting Qubits Pulse Control with OpenPulse
The objective of this course is to be a practical introduction to pulse-level control of superconducting qubits with the OpenPulse grammar from OpenQasm 3.0, but also explain the physical concepts to be able to understand and design experiments with this language. Additionally, we will focus on the particular hardware backend from QMIO, taking a look into which features are implemented.

## Requirements

## Content
The material for this course will be in Jupyter Notebooks format (.ipynb), but they will also be available in PDF. <br>
This is the recommended course flow:
1. **Pulse Control and Readout in Superconducting Qubits (scq-intro.ipynb)**: introduction to superconducting qubits' physics, drive and measurement.
2. **OpenPulse Grammar (openpulse-grammar.ipynb)**: introduction to OpenQasm 3.0's OpenPulse grammar and QMIO's implemented features.
3. **Tutorial Experiment (exp-tutorial.ipynb)**: a detailed experiment implemented on OpenPulse for QMIO.
4. **Example Experiments (examples/)**: a folder with a set of example experiments both in QMIO and simulated backends, using a custom PulseExperiment class.
