    "#### Encoding a qubit in superconducting circuits\n",
    "The superconducting LC circuit is a basic case where we can define a qubit, this circuit consists of a capacitor and an inductor that exchange their electric and magnetic energies in the same way as a harmonic oscillator. In fact, we can describe its energy as a quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO):\n",
    "$$H_{LC}=\\hbar\\omega_q\\left(a^\\dagger a+\\frac{1}{2}\\right),$$\n",
    "where $\\omega_q$ is called the **resonance frequency**. As it's well known, the QHO has an infinite number of energy eigenstates $H_{LC}\\ket{n}=E_n\\ket{n}=\\hbar\\omega_q\\left(n+1/2\\right)$.<br>\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "A qubit encoding can be performed by restricting the system to a subspace spanned by two of these eigenstates, for example, the conveniently labeled $\\{\\ket{0},\\ket{1}\\}$, which correspond to the ground and first excited states of the oscillator. Since energy is an observable, in principle we could measure it, collapsing the system to either $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$ for any superposition of these states. We could also induce transitions between them by applying energy pulses (photons) with the appropriate energy given by the resonance frequency. But there is a major problem with the LC circuit: its harmonicity. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Imagine we want to transition from the state $\\ket{0}$ to $\\ket{1}$. To do so, we need to apply a pulse of frequency $\\omega_q$, but this frequency is also the transition frequency for $\\ket{1}\\leftrightarrow\\ket{2}$, $\\ket{2}\\leftrightarrow\\ket{3}$, and so on, due to the harmonicity of the oscillator. This means that we do not have control over which transition will occur. For example, if the system is initially in the state $\\ket{1}$ and we want to apply an $X$ gate to transition to $\\ket{0}$, the result of applying a pulse of frequency $\\omega_q$ may be the desired transition to $\\ket{0}$ (via stimulated emission), but also the undesired transition to $\\ket{2}$ (via absorption). The latter leads to population outside the computational subspace, resulting in loss of coherence. <br>\n",

In this setup, driving the resonator with a microwave pulse produces a measurable response that depends on the state of the qubit.

    "First, we declare the grammar that we'll use inside the calibration blocks, in our case the ```\"openpulse\"``` grammar. Inside the ```cal``` block, we import the hardware-defined external variables in which the calibrated frames are stored. This frames can later be accessed and used to interact with the system in the ```defcal``` blocks, referencing this variables. If a frame is not used, we don't need to import it. The tags used in Qmio for each frame are following, where ```QUBIT``` references the **physical qubit** numeration in the device:\n",

    "- **```qQUBIT_drive```**: frame for qubit driving.\n",
    "- **```rQUBIT_measure```**: frame for the resonator's measure pulse.\n",
    "- **```rQUBIT_acquire```**: frame for resonator's measurement acquisition.\n",
