    "#### Encoding a qubit in superconducting circuits\n",
    "The superconducting LC circuit is a basic case where we can define a qubit, this circuit consists on a capacitor and an inductor that exchange their electric and magnetic energies in the same way as a harmonic oscillator. In fact, we can describe its energy as a quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO):\n",
    "$$H_{LC}=\\hbar\\omega_q\\left(a^\\dagger a+\\frac{1}{2}\\right),$$\n",
    "where $\\omega_q$ is called the **resonance frequency**. As it's well known, the QHO has an infinite number of energy eigenstates $H_{LC}\\ket{n}=E_n\\ket{n}=\\hbar\\omega_q\\left(n+1/2\\right)$.<br>\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "A qubit encoding can be performed by restricting the system to a subspace spanned by two of these eigenstates, for example, the conveniently labeled $\\{\\ket{0},\\ket{1}\\}$, which correspond to the ground and first excited states of the oscillator. Since energy is an observable, in principle we could measure it, collapsing the system to either $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$ for any superposition of these states. We could also induce transitions between them by applying energy pulses (photons) with the appropriate energy given by the resonance frequency. But there is a major problem with the LC circuit: its harmonicity. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Imagine we want to transition from the state $\\ket{0}$ to $\\ket{1}$. To do so, we need to apply a pulse of frequency $\\omega_q$, but this frequency is also the transition frequency for $\\ket{1}\\leftrightarrow\\ket{2}$, $\\ket{2}\\leftrightarrow\\ket{3}$, and so on, due to the harmonicity of the oscillator. This means that we do not have control over which transition will occur. For example, if the system is initially in the state $\\ket{1}$ and we want to apply an $X$ gate to transition to $\\ket{0}$, the result of applying a pulse of frequency $\\omega_q$ may be the desired transition to $\\ket{0}$ (via stimulated emission), but also the undesired transition to $\\ket{2}$ (via absorption). The latter leads to population outside the computational subspace, resulting in loss of coherence. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The most popular configuration for superconducting qubits, including the so-called **transmons**, is achieved by substituting the inductor with a Josephson junction. This element changes the potential energy profile of the oscillator, resulting in non-equidistant energy levels: \n",
    "$$\\left(E_{n+1}-E_{n}\\right)<\\left(E_{n}-E_{n-1}\\right).$$\n",
    "In this case, the oscillator transitions have different frequencies, allowing control over which transitions can occur when applying a pulse. Considering the most generic expression for its Hamiltonian:\n",
    "$$H=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\hbar\\omega_{n,n+1}a^\\dagger a,\\quad \\omega_{n,n+1}<\\omega_{n-1,n}\\quad \\forall n;$$\n",
    "where $\\omega_{n,n+1}$ is the $\\ket{n}\\leftrightarrow\\ket{n+1}$ transition frequency and the ground-state energy is set to $E_0=0$. If we want to encode our qubit in the $\\{\\ket{0},\\ket{1}\\}$ subspace, we need to use pulses with frequency $\\omega_{01}$, avoiding any other undesired transition.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Usually, we will consider only the computational subspace of the system, assuming negligible populations in any other excited states, using the same model as the LC circuit. Rearranging the energy offset, we can express the Hamiltonian in terms of Pauli operators:\n",
    "$$H=-\\hbar\\omega_q\\frac{\\sigma_z}{2},$$\n",
    "with $\\omega_q=\\omega_{01}$.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Nevertheless, it could be interesting to study the effects of higher excited states. The transmon system is usually modeled as a Duffing oscillator:\n",
    "$$H=\\hbar\\omega_qa^\\dagger a+\\frac{\\hbar\\alpha}{2}a^\\dagger a^\\dagger a a,$$\n",
    "where $\\omega_q=\\omega_{01}$ is the resonance frequency and $\\alpha=\\omega_{12}-\\omega_{01}<0$ is the **anharmonicity** of the qubit. "

    "The models from before assumed that the qubit is an isolated system, meaning that there are no interactions with its environment, so its energy remains constant. This is far from reality, as there are very relevant effects that are expected for an oscillator in a thermal bath. In superconducting computers, the qubits are immersed in a very cold thermal bath, on the order of tens to hundreds of mK, achieved by various cryogenic systems. The objective is to reduce the probability that a residual photon in the cavity with energy $\\hbar\\omega_q$ interacts with the qubit. Defining $k_BT$ as the mean energy of the interactions in a photonic bath at temperature $T$, the regime where the isolated approximation is valid is when $k_BT\\ll \\hbar\\omega_q$.
