    "Now that we understand how a qubit system -such as a transmon- is physically described, we can move into action and learn how to interact with it to change its state and apply transformations equivalent to ideal quantum gates. The physical implementation of this driving depends on the specific hardware -for example, lasers for NV-centers- but in general, it consists of applying pulses to add energy to the system. For example, in supeconducting qubits like transmons, the control is performed by coupling the system to a microwave driving line, which feeds energy to the qubit in a manner analogous to a forced oscillator.\n",

    "Interpreting these pulses as photons, the general idea is to apply them at the resonance frequency of the qubit, which corresponds to the transition frequency of $\\ket{0}\\leftrightarrow\\ket{1}$. As a result, either excitation -via absorption- or relaxation -via stimulated emission- can happen, depending on the qubit's state: \n",
    "\n",
    "- If the qubit is in $\\ket{0}$, only absorption can occur, exciting the system to $\\ket{1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If the qubit is in $\\ket{1}$, the applied photons can't promote the system to a higher state because of the transmon's anharmonicity. In this case, the only possible effect is stimulated emission (similar to what occurs in lasers), which relaxes de qubit back to $\\ket{0}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a continuous pulse of photons is applied, the populations of the states oscillate with time. This behaviour in known as **Rabi oscillations**. These oscillations are key to implementing quantum gates, because their period can be controlled by adjusting the pulse amplitude and duration. For example, by calibrating the pulse duration to completetly populate $\\ket{1}$ starting from $\\ket{0}$, one effectively implements an X gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The pendulum analogy\n",
    "A natural question arises in this setup: **If the qubit is an oscillator, why does its energy sometimes decrease even though we are always adding energy?** The answer lies in the transmon's anharmonicity. If the qubit were a purely harmonic oscillator, driving it at the resonance frequency would lead to unbounded excitation, promoting the system indefinitely through higher energy states -just as in a classical forced harmonic oscillator. The anharmonicity of the transmon limits the population of the oscillator states, as only the $\\ket{0}\\leftrightarrow\\ket{1}$ transition is allowed.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "It may not still be clear how the anharmonicity is responsible of this effect in transmons, fortunatetly, there is a classical system that presents a similar behaviour that could help us visualize it: the **forced non-linear pendulum**. Bringing our attention to the classical pendulum, when the oscillations are small enough, we can model it as an harmonic oscillator with a resonance frequency $\\left(g/L\\right)$, but when the oscillations grow in magnitude, the non-linear terms become relevant and the resonance frequency is shifted. If an oscillating force -pulse- is applied on the pendulum at the resonance frequency of its harmonic regime, the energy of the system will be bounded -meaning that it will reach a maximum amplitude- because the frequency will be detuned by the non-linear terms.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Although they are not physically equivalent systems, we can make the following analogy: when the pendulum has the minimum potential energy (no amplitude) we say that it's on the state $\\ket{0}$, and it is in state $\\ket{1}$ when it has the maximum aplitude. Obviously, for the classical pendulum there is an infinite number of energy eigenstates between those two, but we can understand these intermidiate states as the superposition of $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$. The observed amplitude from the oscillation can be interpreted as the mean value, which depends on the populations of both states. The following video is a representation of this system with a constant amplitude pulse driving, keep in mind that this simulation is for the classical ecuations of the forced non-linear pendulum:\n",

    "As you can see, the system starts with zero energy $\\left(\\ket{0}\\right)$, and, at first, the incoming pulse produces the excitation, promoting the state and increasing the mean energy. This is analogous to the state $\\ket{1}$ being populated by absorption. After some time, we arrive to the maximum amplitude $\\left(\\ket{1}\\right)$, from where the mean energy begins to decrease again. This is analogous to the relaxation of the system by stimulated emission. Finally, the characteristic Rabi-like periodic behaviour appears as the pulse continues to being applied.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen before, the application of a quantum gate, for example an X gate, can be performed by choosing the appropiate duration of the pulse -depending also on its amplitude- that leaves the system totally excited. We can also visualize this with the forced pendulum, where we only need to stop applying the pulse when the oscillator reaches its maximum amplitude. On the next video, you can see that the systems starts at the minimum of energy -representing state $\\ket{0}$- and when the pulse stops, it leaves the system in the maximum energy that could be achieved by the resonance -representing state $\\ket{1}$.\n",

    "In last section we used a pulse with a constant amplitude envelope, meaning $s(t)=1$, because it's the most simple case and the time evolution is easily solvable. Nevertheless, it's not the only -nor the best- option, as it has some unwanted interaction due to a weak anharmonicity. Effectively, we could use any shape for the pulse, as the Rabi oscillation will depend only on its integral.<br>\n",

    "- **Gaussian pulses**: it can be proven by simulation that gaussian pulses reduce the off-resonance interactions due to weak anharmonicity. They consist on a pulse that follows a truncated gaussian distribution, with the maximum value at half the duration of the pulse. Gaussian pulses have three parameters: **amplitude**, **duration** and **standard deviation**. It's common to calibrate them by fixing the duration and standard deviation. The general expression for the envelope is: $s(t)=e^{-\\frac{(t-T/2)^2}{2\\sigma^2}},$\n",
    "where $A$ is the amplitude, $T$ is the pulse duration and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DRAG (Derivative Reduction by Adiabatic Gate) pulses**: although gaussian pulses reduce this effects, the do not remove them, generating leakage out of the computational subspace and inducing phase shifts from the theorical for the gate. The DRAG protocol uses a diferent envelope for the two pulse components $\\left(\\mathcal{I}\\text{ and }\\mathcal{Q}\\right)$, it's characterized by a **correction parameter** $\\beta$ and a -usually- gaussian envelope $s(t)$:\n",
