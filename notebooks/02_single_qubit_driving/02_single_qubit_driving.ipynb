    "Now that we know how a qubit system -such as a transmon- is physically described, we can jump into action and learn how we can interact with it, to change its state and apply transformations equivalent to the ideal quantum gates. Again, the physical implementation of this driving depends on the physical system of the hardware -such as lasers for NV-centers- but it generally consists in applying some pulse to add energy to the system. For example, in supeconducting qubits like transmons, the control is performed by coupling the system to a microwave driving line, that feeds energy to the system in a similar way to a forced oscillator.\n",

    "Interpreting this pulses as photons, the general idea is to apply them with the resonance frequency of the system, which is the transition frequency of $\\ket{0}\\leftrightarrow\\ket{1}$. As a result, either exictation -via absortion- or relaxation -via stimulated emision- will happen to the system, depending on the state of the qubit. If the state is $\\ket{0}$, only absortion can happen, so the qubit system will be excited to $\\ket{1}$. On the other hand, if the state is $\\ket{1}$, the applied photons can't promote the system to a higher state, because of the transmon's anharmonicity, so the only possible effect is a stimulated emission -similar to what happens in lasers- that relaxes de system. When a continous pulse of fotons is applied, the populations of the states will start to oscillate with time. This behaviour in known as **Rabi oscillations** and they are key for quantum gate implementation, as we can set its period by adjusting the applied pulse. For example, if we can calibrate the time we need for the $\\ket{1}$ to be complete populated, starting form $\\ket{0}$, we would have implemented an X gate.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "But a very interesting question may arise when trying to understand this setup: If the qubit is an oscillator, why does the energy of the qubit decrease when we are always adding energy to the system? The solution lies in the transmon anharmonicity. If we would have used an harmonic oscillator for our qubit, adding photons with the resonance frequency would result, in fact, in an unbounded resonance of the system, promoting indefinetly through its energy states, just like in the classical forced harmonic oscillator. The anharmonicity of the transmon limits the population of the oscillator states, as only the $\\ket{0}\\leftrightarrow\\ket{1}$ transition is allowed.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In summary, Rabi oscillation on transmons happens because the oscillator is not harmonic, as a matter of fact, we can find a similar -though not physically equivalent- classical behaviour on the **forced non-linear pendulum**. On the classical pendulum, when the oscillation are small enough we can model it as a harmonic oscillator with a resonance frequency but, when the oscillation become greater, the non-linear terms shift this resonance frequency. This means that if we apply a oscillating force -pulse- on the pendulum with the resonance frequency of its harmonic regime, the energy of the system will be bounded, as its frequency will detune. We can see that this behaviour is similar -but not exactly- to the transmon, where this detuning is due to the natural anharmonicity of the system.\n",
