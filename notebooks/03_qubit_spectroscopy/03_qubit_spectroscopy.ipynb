    "\n",
    "- We set the driving frequency at the resonance of the qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in reality, transmons have higher energy levels that can be accessed by microwave pulses. For example, the second excited state $\\ket{2}$ can be reached if we know the anharmonicity $\\alpha$ of the qubit. We could apply a pulse of frequency $\\omega_q+\\alpha$ to promote from $\\ket{1}$ to $\\ket{2}$, or one with frequency $2\\omega_q+\\alpha$ to promote directly from $\\ket{0}$. But, how can we measure these higher energy states? These states also produce a shift in the energy levels of the driven resonator, inducing a distinct observable response. When working with IQ-mixing readout, this would result in clouds on the IQ plane different from $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunatetly, in Qmio we don't have access to these IQ measurements, only to their projection to the $\\ket{0}$-$\\ket{1}$ bisector. This is a problem especially for the case of $\\ket{2}$, as its cloud lands right above $\\ket{1}$, making them practically undistinguishable from their bisector projection. This means that we can't directly measure $\\omega_{12}$ or even $\\omega_{02}$, as it would lead to a high error from the readout. Nevertheless, there is another effect that we can use to measure the anharmonicity.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The **two-photon absorption (TPA)** is the simultaneous absorption of two photons -with or without identical frequencies- where the system is promoted through a virtual energy level. In our case, this effect can promote the system from $\\ket{0}$ to $\\ket{2}$ with photons of frequency $\\omega_q+\\alpha/2$. Why is the convenient? First, we don't need to access the first excited state to prometo to $\\ket{2}$, so we can interpret all the measurements in the bisector as the $\\ket{2}$ with minimal readout error. Second, these frequency is close to the operative frequency of the qubit, much more convenient than the one for the one-photon $\\ket{0}$-$\\ket{2}$ transition. What we need to keep in mind is that TPA depends on the simultaneous absorption of two photons, reducing its probability compared to one-photon absorptions, which would lead to a less populated $\\ket{2}$.\n"
