## Notebooks

### [1. Introduction to qubit physics](notebook01.md)
To understand how quantum gates are implemented, we first need to examine the qubit's physical system. In this notebook, we will see how a qubit is encoded in superconducting circuits, which approximations can be used depending on our goals, what effects arise from the interactions with the thermal bath, how the qubit-resonator interaction enables measurements, and how to define the parameters of this systems in OpenPulse.

### [2. Single-qubit pulse control](notebook02.md)
The pulse-level implementation of some of the most common native gates will be explored, including the physical meaning of qubit driving, the different techniques and features available in Qmio using the OpenPulse grammar, and illustrative examples of gate calibration and single-qubit operations based on Rabi oscillations.

### [3. Qubit spectroscopy](notebook03.md)
Pulses give grain-level access to the transmon dynamics, like excitation to higher energy states. In this notebook we'll see how the qubit responds to pulses with different frequencies, exploring some observable fenomena at Qmio.


### [4. Two-qubit pulse control](notebook04.md)
Entanglement is one of the pillars behind quantum computing. On this notebook we will explore how the entanglement between qubit systems is physically achieved, which are the most common methods and how to implement some of them with OpenPulse.
