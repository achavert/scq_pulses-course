## Course

### [1. Introduction to qubit physics](notebook01.md)
To understand how qubits are controlled to implement quantum gates, we first need to examine the qubit's physical system. In this notebook, we will see how a qubit is encoded in superconducting circuits, which approximations can be used depending on our goals, what effects arise from the interactions with the thermal bath, how the qubit-resonator interaction enables measurements, and how to define the parameters of this systems in OpenPulse.

### [2. Single-qubit pulse control](notebook02.md)
The pulse-level implementation of some of the most common native gates will be explored, including the physical meaning of qubit driving, the different techniques and features available in Qmio using the OpenPulse grammar, and illustrative examples of gate calibration and single-qubit operations based on Rabi oscillations.
#### Qubit pulse driving
#### Rabi oscillations and pulse gates
#### Pulse waveforms
#### Qubit driving with OpenPulse
#### Gate calibration examples

### 3. Two qubit pulse control
#### The CR and ECR gates
#### Multi-qubit driving with OpenPulse
#### ECR calibration example

### 4. Advanced examples
