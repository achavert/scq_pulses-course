## Course

### [1. Introduction to qubit physics](notebook01.md)
To understand how qubits are controlled to implement quantum gates, we first need to examine the qubit's physical system. In this notebook, we will see how a qubit is encoded in superconducting circuits, which approximations can be used depending on our goals, what effects arise from the interactions with the thermal bath, how the qubit-resonator interaction enables measurements, and how to define the parameters of this systems in OpenPulse.

### 2. Single qubit pulse control
#### Qubit pulse driving
#### Rabi oscillations and pulse gates
#### Pulse waveforms
#### Qubit driving with OpenPulse
#### Gate calibration examples

### 3. Two qubit pulse control
#### The CR and ECR gates
#### Multi-qubit driving with OpenPulse
#### ECR calibration example

### 4. Advanced examples
