## Course

### [1. Introduction to qubit physics](notebook01.md)
To understand how qubits are controlled to implement quantum gates, first we need to take a look at the qubit's physical system. On this notebook, we'll see how a qubit is encoded in superconducting circuits, which approximations may be used depending on our goals, what effects are expected from the thermal bath interaction, how does the qubit-resonator interaction work to perform measurements and how to define in OpenPulse the parameters for this systems.

### 2. Single qubit pulse control
#### Qubit pulse driving
#### Rabi oscillations and pulse gates
#### Pulse waveforms
#### Qubit driving with OpenPulse
#### Gate calibration examples

### 3. Two qubit pulse control
#### The CR and ECR gates
#### Multi-qubit driving with OpenPulse
#### ECR calibration example

### 4. Advanced examples
